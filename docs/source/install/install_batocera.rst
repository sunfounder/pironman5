Install the Batocera Linux
======================================================

|link_batocera| is an open-source and completely free retro-gaming distribution that can be copied to a USB stick or an SD card with the aim of turning any computer/nano computer into a gaming console during a game or permanently.

You can choose the installation method based on whether you have a Micro SD or an NVMe SSD at hand.

Installing directly onto the NVMe SSD involves an additional step compared to installing on the Micro SD: you must update the Raspberry Pi's bootloader because it defaults to boot from the Micro SD card. Update the bootloader to prioritize booting from the NVMe SSD.
