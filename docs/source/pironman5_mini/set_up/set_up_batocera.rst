=========================================================

If you have installed the Batocera.linux OS, you can remotely log in to this system via SSH and then follow the steps below to complete the configuration.

#. Once the system boots up, use ssh to remotely connect to Pironman5. For Windows, you can open **Powershell**, and for Mac OS X and Linux, you can directly open **Terminal**.
