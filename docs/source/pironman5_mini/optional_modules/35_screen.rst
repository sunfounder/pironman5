3.5-inch Touch Screen
=============================

.. note::

    The Pironman 5 series do not include a 3.5-inch touch screen.  
    You will need to prepare one yourself or purchase it from our official website:

   * `3.5-ihch Touch Screen <https://www.sunfounder.com/products/touchscreen-02>`_

The 3.5-inch touch screen connects directly to the Raspberry Pi GPIO header,  
providing both display and touch control for the Pironman 5.  
Please follow the steps carefully to ensure correct installation and avoid hardware damage.

More details can be found here:  
`3.5-inch touch screen Documentation <http://wiki.sunfounder.cc/index.php?title=3.5_Inch_LCD_Touch_Screen_Monitor_for_Raspberry_Pi>`_.

.. warning:: 
   
   When installing the 3.5-inch touch screen onto the Pironman 5, ensure the pins are perfectly aligned.  
   The header must match the Raspberry Piâ€™s GPIO interface with no offset.  
   Misalignment may damage the screen or even the Raspberry Pi.  
   Double-check connections before powering on!

**Remove RGB Jumper**

When using the Pironman 5 with the 3.5-inch touch screen,  
note that the RGB LEDs on the IO Expander share the same SPI MOSI pin (GPIO10) as the screen.  
To prevent conflicts and ensure proper operation:

1. On the IO Expander, remove the jumper cap from the **RGB LED pins** (above J9).

2. Disable the RGB LED control service:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pironman5 -re false
      sudo systemctl restart pironman5.service

This frees the SPI interface for the 3.5-inch touch screen and avoids display issues.


**Driver Installation**

Before using the 3.5-inch touch screen, youâ€™ll need to install the drivers.

General tips:

* Make sure git is installed (``sudo apt install git``).  
* Driver installation takes 1â€“3 minutes.  
* The system will reboot automatically.

Follow the instructions for your operating system below:

* **For Raspberry Pi OS**:

  .. code-block:: bash
  
     sudo rm -rf LCD-show 
     git clone https://github.com/sunfounder/LCD-show.git 
     chmod -R 755 LCD-show 
     cd LCD-show/ 
     sudo ./LCD35-show
  
  After installation, the desktop will display on the 3.5-inch touch screen.
  
  To rotate the display:
  
  .. code-block:: bash
  
     cd LCD-show/
     sudo ./rotate.sh 90   
  
  The system will reboot, and the screen will rotate 90Â°.  
  You can replace ``90`` with ``0``, ``180``, or ``270`` as needed.



* **For Ubuntu**:

  .. code-block:: bash
  
     sudo rm -rf LCD-show-ubuntu 
     git clone https://github.com/sunfounder/LCD-show-ubuntu.git 
     chmod -R 755 LCD-show-ubuntu 
     cd LCD-show-ubuntu/ 
     sudo ./LCD35-show
  
  After installation, the desktop will display on the 3.5-inch touch screen.
  
  To rotate:
  
  .. code-block:: bash
  
     cd LCD-show-ubuntu/
     sudo ./rotate.sh 90   
  
  Reboot will follow automatically.  
  Replace ``90`` with ``0``, ``180``, or ``270`` as needed.



* **For Kali Linux**:

  .. code-block:: bash
  
     sudo rm -rf LCD-show-kali 
     git clone https://github.com/sunfounder/LCD-show-kali.git 
     chmod -R 755 LCD-show-kali 
     cd LCD-show-kali/ 
     sudo ./LCD35-show
  
  After installation, the desktop will display on the 3.5-inch touch screen.
  
  To rotate:
  
  .. code-block:: bash
  
     cd LCD-show-kali/
     sudo ./rotate.sh 90   
  
  The system will reboot with the new rotation.  
  Replace ``90`` with ``0``, ``180``, or ``270`` as needed.
