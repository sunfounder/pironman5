7. Optional Modules: Camera, 3.5'' Screen, RTL-SDR
==============================================================

.. note::

    The Pironman 5 series products do not include the following modules.  
    You need to prepare them yourself or purchase them from our official website:

    * `Camera Module <https://www.sunfounder.com/products/ov5647-camera-module>`_
    * `3.5'' Touch Screen <https://www.sunfounder.com/products/touchscreen-02>`_
    * `RTL-SDR Blog V4 <https://www.sunfounder.com/products/rtl-sdr-blog-v4>`_
    
This section explains how to expand the capabilities of the Pironman 5 series by integrating optional hardware modules, including a camera module, a 3.5-inch touchscreen display, and an RTL-SDR radio receiver.
By combining these add-ons, you can enhance interactivity, enable real-time visual input, and unlock advanced wireless signal reception.
