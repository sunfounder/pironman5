Camera Module
===========================================

Follow these steps to assemble the Camera Module:

1. Remove the two acrylic panels from the case.

4. Disassemble the module group. This involves removing a rivet, which should be done by pushing the central shaft of the rivet out with a screwdriver, then removing the entire rivet.

8. Connect the FPC to the Raspberry Pi. This step is very compact and requires careful handling.

9. Power on the host and check if the Camera Module is properly connected.

   * First, connect a display to the Raspberry Pi or establish a VNC connection.
   * Once the display is set up, open a terminal and run the following command:  ``raspistill -o test.jpg``
   * If the Camera Module is functioning correctly, this command will capture an image and save it as ``test.jpg``.
   * Open ``test.jpg`` to verify that the image has been successfully captured.

10. Reassemble the Power Switch Converter back into the case.
