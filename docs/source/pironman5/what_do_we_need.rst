1. What Else Should You Prepare?
===================================

To get started with your Pironman 5, you'll need to gather a few essential components and some optional extras depending on your project requirements.

**Essential Components**

* Raspberry Pi 5 

    The Pironman 5 is fully compatible with the Raspberry Pi 5.

* 5V/5A Power Adapter

    A 5V/5A power adapter is required to power the Pironman 5 and its components.

* Micro SD Card
 
    It is recommended to use an SD card with a minimum of 16GB of storage for Raspberry Pi OS. For Raspberry Pi OS Lite, a minimum of 4GB is advised.

**Optional Components**

* M.2 NVMe SSD

    The Pironman 5 features an NVMe PIP with an M.2 SSD connector, accommodating four NVMe M.2 SSD sizes: 2230, 2242, 2260, and 2280. The connection is certified for Gen 2.0 speeds (5 GT/sec), but you can force it to Gen 3.0 (10 GT/sec).

* Screen

    To access the Raspberry Pi's desktop environment, a screen such as a TV or a computer monitor is required.
    
* HDMI Cable

    The Raspberry Pi 5's HDMI ports have been adapted to standard HDMI Type A interfaces via a USB HDMI adapter. Therefore, a standard HDMI to HDMI cable is needed to connect the Pironman 5 to a display.

* Mouse & Keyboard

    Any USB port on the Pironman 5 can be used to connect a wired keyboard and mouse, or a USB Bluetooth receiver for wireless peripherals.

By ensuring you have these components ready, you'll be fully equipped to set up and enjoy your Pironman 5 with your Raspberry Pi 5!
