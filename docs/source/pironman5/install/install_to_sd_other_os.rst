If you are using a Micro SD card, you can follow the tutorial below to install the system onto your Micro SD card.


**Required Components**

* A Personal Computer
* A Micro SD card and Reader

**Steps**

#. Insert your SD card into your computer or laptop using a Reader.

#. Within the |link_rpi_imager|, click **Raspberry Pi Device** and select the **Raspberry Pi 5** model from the dropdown list.

#. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and select the your operating system.

   .. note::

      * For **Ubuntu** system, you need to click **Other general-purpose OS** -> **Ubuntu**, and select either **Ubuntu Desktop 24.04 LTS (64 bit)** or **Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (64 bit)**.
      * For **Kali Linux**, **Home Assistant** and **Homebridge** systems, you need to click **Other specific-purpose OS** and then select the corresponding system.

#. Click **NEXT**.

   .. note::

      * For systems that cannot be configured in advance, after clicking **NEXT**, you will be prompted whether to save the data within the device. If you have confirmed that a backup has been made, select **Yes**.

      * For systems where the Hostname, WiFi, and Enable SSH can be configured in advance, a pop-up will appear prompting whether to apply the OS's custom settings. You can choose **Yes** or **No**, or go back to edit further.

   * Define a **hostname** for your Raspberry Pi. The hostname is your Raspberry Pi's network identifier. You can access your Pi using ``<hostname>.local`` or ``<hostname>.lan``.

   * Create a **Username** and **Password** for the Raspberry Pi's administrator account. Establishing a unique username and password is vital for securing your Raspberry Pi, which lacks a default password.

   * Configure the wireless LAN by providing your network's **SSID** and **Password**.

     .. note::

       Set the ``Wireless LAN country`` to the two-letter `ISO/IEC alpha2 code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements>`_ corresponding to your location.

   * To remotely connect to your Raspberry Pi, enable SSH in the Services tab.

     * For **password authentication**, use the username and password from the General tab.
     * For public-key authentication, choose "Allow public-key authentication only". If you have an RSA key, it will be used. If not, click "Run SSH-keygen" to generate a new key pair.

   * The **Options** menu lets you configure Imager's behavior during a write, including playing sound when finished, ejecting media when finished, and enabling telemetry.

#. If the SD card contains existing data, ensure you back it up to prevent data loss. Proceed by clicking **Yes** if no backup is needed.

#. When you see the "Write Successful" popup, your image has been completely written and verified. You're now ready to boot a Raspberry Pi from the Micro SD Card!
