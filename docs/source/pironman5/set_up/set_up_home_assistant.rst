Seting Up on Home Assistant
============================================

If you have installed the Home Assistant system, you will need to add the necessary add-ons to Home Assistant and start them to get the Pironman 5 working.

.. note::

    The following method is only applicable to systems with Home Assistant installed natively. It does not apply to Raspberry Pi systems with Home Assistant installed on top or to Docker versions of Home Assistant.

1. Log in to Home Assistant
-----------------------------

* After starting Pironman 5, it is recommended to plug in an Ethernet cable directly. This way, you can open your computer browser and enter: ``homeassistant.local:8123`` to access Home Assistant.

2. Add the SunFounder Add-ons Repository
----------------------------------------------------

The functionality of Pironman 5 is installed on Home Assistant in the form of add-ons. First, you need to add the **SunFounder** add-ons repository.

#. Open **Settings** -> **Add-ons**.

#. In the add-on store, click the menu in the top right corner and select **Repositories**.

   .. image:: img/home_add_res.png
      :width: 90%

#. Enter the **SunFounder** add-ons repository URL: ``https://github.com/sunfounder/home-assistant-addon``, and click **ADD**.

#. After successfully adding, close the pop-up window and refresh the page. Find the SunFounder add-ons list.

3. Install the **Pi Config Wizard** Add-on
------------------------------------------------------

The **Pi Config Wizard** can help enable the configurations needed for Pironman 5, such as I2C and SPI. If not needed afterward, it can be removed.

#. Find **Pi Config Wizard** in the SunFounder add-ons list and click to enter.

   .. image:: img/home_pi_config.png
      :width: 90%

#. On the **Pi Config Wizard** page, click **INSTALL**. Wait for the installation to complete.

   .. image:: img/home_config_install.png
      :width: 90%

#. After the installation is complete, switch to the **Log** page to confirm if there are any errors.

   .. image:: img/home_log.png
      :width: 90%

#. If there are no errors, return to the **Info** page and click **START** to start this add-on.

   .. image:: img/home_start.png
      :width: 90%

#. Now open the WEB UI.

   .. image:: img/home_open_web_ui.png
      :width: 90%

#. In the Web UI, you will see an option to mount the Boot partition. Click **MOUNT** to mount the partition.

   .. image:: img/home_mount_boot.png
      :width: 90%

#. After successful mounting, you will see options to set I2C, SPI, and edit the config.txt file. Check I2C and SPI to enable them. Once they show as enabled, click the reboot button at the bottom to restart the Raspberry Pi.

   .. image:: img/home_i2c_spi.png
      :width: 90%

#. After the restart, refresh the page. You will return to the mount boot partition page again. Click **MOUNT** again.

   .. image:: img/home_mount_boot.png
      :width: 90%

#. Usually, you will see that SPI is enabled, but I2C is not because I2C requires two reboots. Enable I2C again, then restart the Raspberry Pi.

   .. image:: img/home_enable_i2c.png
      :width: 90%

#. After the reboot, return to the **MOUNT** page again. You will see that both I2C and SPI are enabled.

   .. image:: img/home_i2c_spi_enable.png
      :width: 90%

.. note::

    * If after refreshing the page, you do not enter the mount partition page, you can click **Settings** -> **Add-ons** -> **Pi Config Wizard** again.
    * Check if this add-on is started. If not, click **START**.
    * After starting, click **OPEN WEB UI**, then click **MOUNT** to confirm if I2C and SPI are enabled.

4. Install the **Pironman 5** Add-on
---------------------------------------------

Now officially start installing the **Pironman 5** add-on.

#. Open **Settings** -> **Add-ons**.

   .. image:: img/home_setting_addon.png
