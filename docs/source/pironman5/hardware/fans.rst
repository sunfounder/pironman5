PWM Fan
-----------------

The PWM fan in the Pironman 5 is managed by the Raspberry Pi system and forms the cornerstone of its smart cooling solution, especially under heavy loads. This system combines a primary PWM fan with two supplementary RGB fans for enhanced cooling performance, closely integrated with the Raspberry Pi 5's thermal management system.

**Environmental Parameters**

* **Operating Temperature**: -10Â°C ~ 70Â°C  
* **Storage Temperature**: -40Â°C ~ 75Â°C  
* **Operating Humidity**: 5% ~ 90% RH  
* **Storage Humidity**: 5% ~ 95% RH  

**Fan Speed Control Based on Temperature**  

The PWM fan operates dynamically, adjusting its speed according to the Raspberry Pi 5's temperature:  

* **Below 50Â°C**: Fan remains off (0% speed).  
* **At 50Â°C**: Fan operates at low speed (30% speed).  
* **At 60Â°C**: Fan increases to medium speed (50% speed).  
* **At 67.5Â°C**: Fan ramps up to high speed (70% speed).  
* **At 75Â°C and above**: Fan operates at full speed (100% speed).  

This temperature-to-speed control includes a 5Â°C hysteresis to prevent frequent speed changes. For instance, the fan will reduce its speed only after the temperature drops 5Â°C below each threshold.  

The following commands allow users to monitor the PWM fan's operation:  

To check the fan's current state:
