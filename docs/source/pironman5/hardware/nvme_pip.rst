Pi5 NVMe PIP
=================

The Pi5 NVMe PIP (PCIe Peripheral Board), as defined by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, is a PCIe adapter board designed specifically for NVMe solid-state drives. It supports four different sizes of NVMe SSDs: 2230, 2242, 2260, and 2280, all fitting into an M.2 M key slot.

* The board connects through a 16P 0.5mm reverse FFC (Flexible Flat Cable) or a custom impedance-matched FPC (Flexible Printed Circuit) cable.
* **STA**: A Status LED indicator.
* **PWR**: A Power LED indicator.
* The onboard 3.3V power supply can support up to 3A output. However, since the Raspberry Pi PCIe interface is limited to providing 5V/1A output (equivalent to 5W), additional power for 3.3V/3A usage can be supplied through the J3 connector from a 5V source.
* **FORCE ENABLE**: The onboard power supply is activated by the switch signal from the PCIe interface. After the Raspberry Pi is powered on, it sends a signal to turn on the 3.3V power supply. If some systems do not support the switch signal or for other reasons, you can short-circuit J4 FORCE ENABLE by soldering a wire between the two floating pads to force the onboard 3.3V power supply to power the NVMe.

About the Model
---------------------------

M.2 SSDs, known for their compact size, come in various types mainly differentiated by their keying (notch design on the connector) and the interface they use. Here are the primary types:

* **M.2 SATA SSDs**: These use the SATA interface, similar to 2.5-inch SATA SSDs but in the smaller M.2 form factor. They are limited by the SATA III maximum speeds of around 600 MB/s. These SSDs are compatible with M.2 slots keyed for B and M keys.
* **M.2 NVMe SSDs**: These SSDs use the NVMe protocol over PCIe lanes and are significantly faster than M.2 SATA SSDs. They are suitable for applications requiring high read/write speeds like gaming, video editing, and data-intensive tasks. These SSDs typically require M-keyed slots. These drives utilize the PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) interface, with different versions like 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0. Each new version of PCIe effectively doubles the data transfer speed of its predecessor. However, the Raspberry Pi 5 uses a PCIe 3.0 interface, capable of delivering transfer speeds up to 3,500 MB/s. 

M.2 SSDs come in three key types: B key, M key, and B+M key. However, later on, the B+M key was introduced, combining the functionalities of the B key and M key. As a result, it replaced the standalone B key. Please refer to the image below.

In general, M.2 SATA SSDs are B+M-keyed (can fit in sockets for B-keyed and M-keyed modules), while M.2 NVMe SSDs for PCIe 3.0 x4 lane are M-keyed.

About the Length
-----------------------

M.2 modules come in different sizes and can also be utilized for Wi-Fi, WWAN, Bluetooth, GPS, and NFC.

Pironman 5 supports four (PCIe Gen 2.0 / PCIe Gen 3.0) NVMe M.2 SSD sizes based on their names: 2230, 2242, 2260, and 2280. The "22" is the width in millimeters (mm), and the two following numbers are the length. The longer the drive, the more NAND flash chips can be mounted; therefore, the more capacity.
