IO Expander
================

RGB LEDs
------------

.. image:: img/io_board_rgb.png

The board features 4 WS2812 RGB LEDs, offering customizable control. Users can turn them on or off, change the color, adjust the brightness, switch display modes, and set the speed of changes.

* To modify the on and off state of the RGB LEDs, ``true`` to turn on the RGB LEDs, ``false`` to turn them off.

.. code-block:: shell

  pironman5 -re true

* To change their color, input the desired hexadecimal color values, such as ``fe1a1a``.

.. code-block:: shell

  pironman5 -rc fe1a1a

* To change the brightness of the RGB LED (range: 0 ~ 100%):

.. code-block:: shell

  pironman5 -rb 100

* To switch RGB LED display modes, choose from options: ``solid/breathing/flow/flow_reverse/rainbow/rainbow_reverse/hue_cycle``:

.. note::

  If you set the RGB LED display mode to ``rainbow``, ``rainbow_reverse``, or ``hue_cycle``, you will not be able to set the color using ``pironman5 -rc``.

.. code-block:: shell

  pironman5 -rs breathing

* To modify the speed of change (range: 0 ~ 100%):

.. code-block:: shell

  pironman5 -rp 80

RGB Control Pin
-------------------------

The RGB LEDs are driven by SPI and connected to **GPIO10**, which is also the SPI MOSI pin. The two pins above J9 are used to connect the RGB LEDs to GPIO10. If not needed, the jumper can be removed.

  .. image:: img/io_board_rgb_pin.png

RGB OUT Pins
-------------------------

.. image:: img/io_board_rgb_out.png

The WS2812 RGB LEDs support serial connection, allowing for the attachment of an external RGB LED strip. Connect the **SIG** pin to the external strip's **DIN** pin for expansion.

The default setup includes 4 RGB LEDs. Connect additional LEDs and update the count using:

.. code-block:: shell

  pironman5 -rl 12


OLED Screen Connector
----------------------------

The OLED screen connector, with an address of 0x3C, is a key feature.

.. image:: img/io_board_oled.png

If the OLED Screen is not displaying or displaying incorrectly, you can follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue:

Check if the FPC cable of the OLED Screen is properly connected.

#. Use the following command to view the program's run logs and check for error messages.

    .. code-block:: shell

        cat /opt/pironman5/log

#. Alternatively, use the following command to check if the OLED's i2c address 0x3C is recognized:
    
    .. code-block:: shell
        
        sudo i2cdetect -y 1

#. If the first two steps don't reveal any issues, try restarting the pironman5 service to see if that resolves the problem.


    .. code-block:: shell

        sudo systemctl restart pironman5.service


Infrared Receiver
---------------------------

.. image:: img/io_board_receiver.png

* **Model**: IRM-56384, operating at 38KHz.
* **Connection**: The IR receiver connects to **GPIO13**.
* **D1**: An infrared reception indicator that blinks upon signal detection.
* **J8**: A pin for enabling the infrared function. By default, a jumper cap is inserted for immediate functionality. Remove the cap to free GPIO13 if the IR receiver is not in use.

To utilize the IR receiver, verify its connection and install the necessary module:

* Test the connection:

  .. code-block:: shell

    sudo ls /dev |grep lirc

* Install the ``lirc`` module:

  .. code-block:: shell

    sudo apt-get install lirc -y

* Now, test the IR Receiver by running the following command. 

  .. code-block:: shell

    mode2 -d /dev/lirc0

* After running the command, press a button on the remote control, and the code of that button will be printed.


RGB Fan Pins
---------------

The IO expansion board supports up to two 5V non-PWM fans. Both fans are controlled together. 

**FAN1** and **FAN 2** are two sets of fan pins. You need to connect the fan's red wire to "+", and the black wire to "-".

.. image:: img/io_board_fan.png

The two pins below J9 are the enable pins for RGB fans. By default, a jumper is inserted on these pins, allowing control of the fans' on and off state using GPIO6. If fan operation is not desired, the jumper can be removed to free GPIO6.

.. image:: img/io_board_fan_j9.png

**D2** is a fan signal indicator that lights up when the fan is active.

.. image:: img/io_board_fan_d2.png

You can use command to configure the operating mode of the two RGB fans. These modes determine the conditions under which the RGB fans will activate.

For instance, if set to **1: Performance** mode, the RGB fans will activate at 50Â°C.

.. code-block:: shell

  pironman5 -gm 3

* **4: Quiet**: The RGB fans will activate at 70Â°C.
* **3: Balanced**: The RGB fans will activate at 67.5Â°C.
* **2: Cool**: The RGB fans will activate at 60Â°C.
* **1: Performance**: The RGB fans will activate at 50Â°C.
* **0: Always On**: The RGB fans will always on.

If you connect the control pin of the RGB fan to different pins on the Raspberry Pi, you can use the following command to change the pin number.

.. code-block:: shell

  sudo pironman5 -gp 18

Pin Headers
--------------

.. image:: img/io_board_pin_header.png

Two right-angle header connectors extend the Raspberry Pi's GPIO, but note that the IR receiver, RGB LED, and fan occupy some pins. Remove the corresponding jumper caps to utilize these pins for other functions.
