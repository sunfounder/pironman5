3. About Airflow Direction
-------------------------------

The airflow in the Pironman 5 chassis is carefully engineered to maximize cooling efficiency. Cool air enters the case primarily through the GPIO interface and other small openings, ensuring an even intake. It then passes through the Tool Cooler, equipped with a high-performance fan to regulate internal temperatures, and is finally expelled through the two RGB fans on the side panel.
