* **Extreme Cooling**: Tower cooler with PWM fan plus two RGB fans, keeping a 100% load Pi at just 39Â°C in a 25Â°C room.
* **Smart OLED Display**: Real-time CPU, memory, temperature, disk usage, IP address, and more. Tap to wake with built-in vibration sensor.
* **Customizable RGB Lighting**: Four WS2812 addressable LEDs light up your setup with vibrant effects.
* **Enhanced Connectivity**: Dual standard HDMI ports, IR receiver for media apps, safe retro-style power button, and labeled external GPIO extender.
* **Premium Build**: Durable aluminum chassis with dark acrylic side panel and spring-loaded card slot for easy access.
* **Flexible Configurations**: RAID 0/1 NAS, SSD + AI combo, or dual AI accelerators for heavy AI workloads.

.. note::

  It is recommended to use the official 27W power supply or |link_sf_27w_supply| for the Pironman 5 series products to avoid insufficient power supply, which may cause the Raspberry Pi 5 to reboot.
