Pironman 5 MAX - NVMe M.2 SSD PCIe Mini PC Case for Raspberry Pi 5
================================================================================


Thanks for choosing our Pironman 5 MAX.


The Pironman 5 Max is the new flagship product in our Pironman Raspberry Pi case series, 
exclusively compatible with the latest Raspberry Pi 5. 

A standout feature of the Pironman 5 Max is its dual transparent sides, 
reminiscent of a PC case, combined with RGB LEDs and two RGB fans, 
adding an impressive flair to the product. 
It includes an OLED screen that displays basic information about the Raspberry Pi, 
and has expanded features such as power on/off buttons and status indicators. 
The micro HDMI port has been converted to a standard HDMI port for more common use, 
and the power and HDMI ports have been relocated to the same side as the Raspberry Piâ€™s USB ports, 
enhancing the aesthetics of the wiring. Equipped with three fans and a tower-style heatsink, 
it greatly assists in reducing the high temperatures of the Raspberry Pi 5. 

The case integrates a PCIe Gen 2 Switch with two M.2 M key PCIe slots supporting 2230, 
2242, 2260, and 2280, allowing the installation of two NVMe Gen2 SSDs or AI accelerators. 
Users can set up two NVMe SSDs in software RAID 0 or RAID 1 for NAS configurations; 
combine one AI accelerator and one NVMe SSD to boost AI performance; 
or use two AI accelerators for even stronger AI capabilities. 
Additionally, GPIO expansion is provided for convenient extension of the Raspberry Piâ€™s functionality.
