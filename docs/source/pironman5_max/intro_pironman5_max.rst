|link_pironman5_max| is a high-end Raspberry Pi case designed exclusively for the Raspberry Pi 5, featuring dual NVMe support for powerful storage and expansion capabilities.

**Key Features**:

* **High-Speed Storage & AI Support**: PCIe Gen 2 switch with two M.2 M-key slots (**2230**, **2242**, **2260**, **2280**) for dual NVMe Gen2 SSDs or AI accelerators (**Gen3 not supported**), including full **Hailo-8/8L** compatibility.
* **Advanced Cooling**: Three fans and a tower cooler for efficient heat dissipation on the Raspberry Pi 5.
* **Smart Display**: Built-in OLED screen showing CPU usage, memory, temperature, and IP address in real time.
* **Enhanced Connectivity**: Upgraded HDMI (micro to standard) with ports aligned for cleaner cable management, customizable RGB LEDs, secure power switch, IR receiver, and external GPIO extender.
* **Flexible Configurations**: RAID 0/1 NAS setups, SSD + AI accelerator combos, or dual AI accelerators for enhanced AI workloads.

.. note::

  It is recommended to use the official 27W power supply or |link_sf_27w_supply| for the Pironman 5 series products to avoid insufficient power supply, which may cause the Raspberry Pi 5 to reboot.
