5. PI5 Fails to Boot (Red LED)?
-------------------------------------------

This issue may be caused by a system update, changes to the boot order, or a corrupted bootloader. You can try the following steps to resolve the problem:

#. Check USB-HDMI Adapter Connection

   * Please carefully check whether the USB-HDMI adapter is securely connected to the PI5.
   * Try unplugging and reconnecting the USB-HDMI adapter.
   * Then reconnect the power supply and check if the PI5 boots successfully.

#. Test PI5 Outside the Case

   * If reconnecting the adapter does not solve the problem:
   * Remove the PI5 from the Pironman 5 case.
   * Power the PI5 directly with the power adapter (without the case).
   * Check if it can boot normally.

#. Restore the Bootloader

   * If the PI5 still cannot boot, the bootloader may be corrupted. You can follow this guide: :ref:`update_bootloader_max` and choose whether to boot from SD card or NVMe/USB.
   * Insert the prepared SD card into the PI5, power it on, and wait at least 10 seconds. Once the recovery is complete, remove and reformat the SD card. 
   * Then, use Raspberry Pi Imager to flash the latest Raspberry Pi OS, insert the card back, and try booting again.

6. OLED Screen Not Working?
------------------------------

.. note:: The OLED screen may turn off automatically after a period of inactivity to save power. You can gently tap the case to trigger the vibration sensor and wake the screen.

If the OLED screen is not displaying or is displaying incorrectly, follow these troubleshooting steps:

2. Confirm that your SSD is properly secured to the NVMe PIP module.  

3. Check the status of the NVMe PIP Module's LEDs:

   After confirming all connections, power on the Pironman 5 MAX and observe the two indicators on the NVMe PIP Module:  

   * **PWR LED**: Should be lit.  
   * **STA LED**: Should blink to indicate normal operation.  

   .. image:: img/dual_nvme_pip_leds.png  

   * If the **PWR LED** is on but the **STA LED** is not blinking, it indicates the NVMe SSD is not recognized by the Raspberry Pi.  
   * If the **PWR LED** is off, short the "Force Enable" pins on the module. If the **PWR LED** lights up, it could indicate a loose FPC cable or unsupported system configuration for NVMe.

   .. image:: img/dual_nvme_pip_j4.png  

     
4. Confirm that your NVMe SSD has a properly installed operating system. Refer to: :ref:`max_install_the_os`.

5. If the wiring is correct and the OS is installed, but the NVMe SSD still fails to boot, try booting from a Micro SD card to verify the functionality of other components. Once confirmed, proceed to: :ref:`max_configure_boot_ssd`.

If the problem persists after performing the above steps, please send an email to service@sunfounder.com. We will respond as soon as possible.
