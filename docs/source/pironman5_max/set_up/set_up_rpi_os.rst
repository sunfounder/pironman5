Set Up on Raspberry Pi/Ubuntu/Kali/Homebridge OS
==================================================

If you have installed Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu, Kali Linux or Homebridge on your Raspberry Pi, you will need to configure the Pironman 5 MAX using the command line. Detailed tutorials can be found below:

.. note::

  Before configuring, you need to boot up and log into your Raspberry Pi. If you're unsure how to log in, you can visit the official Raspberry Pi website: |link_rpi_get_start|.


Configuring Shutdown to Deactivate GPIO Power
------------------------------------------------------------

To prevent the OLED screen and RGB fans, powered by the Raspberry Pi GPIO, from remaining active post-shutdown, it's essential to configure the Raspberry Pi for GPIO power deactivation.

#. Manually edit the ``EEPROM`` configuration file with this command:

   .. code-block:: shell
   
     sudo rpi-eeprom-config -e

#. Modify the ``POWER_OFF_ON_HALT`` setting in the file to ``1``. For instance:

   .. code-block:: shell
   
     BOOT_UART=1
     POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=1
     BOOT_ORDER=0xf41

#. Press ``Ctrl + X``, ``Y`` and ``Enter`` to save the changes.


Downloading and Installing the ``pironman5`` Module
-----------------------------------------------------------

#. For lite systems, initially install tools like ``git``, ``python3``, ``pip3``, ``setuptools``, etc.
  
   .. code-block:: shell
  
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install git -y
     sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-setuptools -y

#. Proceed to download code from GitHub and install the ``pironman5`` module .

   .. code-block:: shell

      cd ~
      git clone -b 1.2.15 https://github.com/sunfounder/pironman5.git --depth 1
      cd ~/pironman5
      sudo python3 install.py

   After successful installation, a system reboot is required to activate the installation. Follow the on-screen reboot prompt.

   Upon reboot, the ``pironman5.service`` will start automatically. Here are the primary configurations for Pironman 5 MAX:
   
   * The OLED screen displays CPU, RAM, Disk Usage, CPU Temperature, and the Raspberry Pi's IP Address.
   * Four WS2812 RGB LEDs will light up in blue with a breathing mode.
     
   .. note::
    
     RGB fans won't spin unless the temperature hits 60Â°C. For different activation temperatures, see :ref:`max_cc_control_fan`.

#. You can use the ``systemctl`` tool to ``start``, ``stop``, ``restart``, or check the ``status`` of ``pironman5.service``.

   .. code-block:: shell
     
      sudo systemctl restart pironman5.service
   
   * ``restart``: Use this command to apply any changes made to the settings of Pironman 5 MAX.
   * ``start/stop``: Enable or disable the ``pironman5.service``.
   * ``status``: Check the operational status of the ``pironman5`` program using the ``systemctl`` tool.
