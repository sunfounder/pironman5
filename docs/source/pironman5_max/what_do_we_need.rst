1. What Else Should We Prepare?
===================================

Before assembling and using your Pironman 5 MAX, please make sure you have the following components ready. Some items are required for basic operation, while others are optional and depend on how you plan to use your Raspberry Pi.

Required Components
------------------------------

* **Raspberry Pi 5**

  The Pironman 5 MAX is fully compatible with the Raspberry Pi 5.

* **27W Power Supply**

  It is recommended to use the official 27W power supply or |link_sf_27w_supply| for the Pironman 5 series products to avoid insufficient power supply, which may cause the Raspberry Pi 5 to reboot.

* **Micro SD Card**

  The Raspberry Pi does not have a built-in hard drive. It boots and stores all files on a **Micro SD card**.

  * Minimum: **16GB**  
  * Recommended: **32GB** for better stability  
  * Brand: Use reliable options such as **SanDisk** or **Samsung** to avoid read/write errors  
  
Optional Components
------------------------

* M.2 NVMe SSD

  The Pironman 5 MAX is equipped with an NVMe PIP that provides two M.2 SSD connectors, supporting four NVMe M.2 SSD form factors: 2230, 2242, 2260, and 2280. The interface operates at PCIe Gen2.0 speeds (Gen3 is not supported).

* **Monitor (HDMI or TV)** 

  For beginners, we strongly recommend a display with an HDMI input, so you can easily configure Raspberry Pi OS and run graphical programs.

* **HDMI Cable**

  The Raspberry Pi 5's HDMI ports have been adapted to standard HDMI Type A interfaces via a USB HDMI adapter. Therefore, a standard HDMI to HDMI cable is needed to connect the Pironman 5 MAX to a display.

* **Keyboard & Mouse**

  Very useful during the initial setup of Raspberry Pi OS. Later, you may switch to remote access (SSH/VNC), but for beginners we recommend preparing a basic USB or wireless set.

**Tips for Preparation**

* If you purchased this kit, most accessories are included, but you still need to prepare the Raspberry Pi board, Micro SD card, and power adapter separately.  
* Not sure what to buy? The most stable and universal choice is: **Raspberry Pi 5 (2GB) + Official Power Supply + 32GB Micro SD card**.
