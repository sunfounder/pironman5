5. Control with Commands or Dashboard
=======================================================

Once you have successfully installed the ``pironman5`` module, the ``pironman5.service`` will automatically start upon reboot.

You can monitor and control the Pironman 5 via commands, or by accessing the dashboard through the webpage at ``http://<ip>:34001``.

.. note::

    * For the **Home Assistant** system, you can only monitor and control the Pironman 5 through the dashboard by opening the webpage at ``http://<ip>:34001``.
    * For the **Batocera.linux** system, you can only monitor and control the Pironman 5 via commands. It is important to note that any changes to the configuration require a restart of the service using ``pironman5 restart`` to take effect.
